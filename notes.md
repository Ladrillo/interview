Start Time: **Saturday morning**; End Time: **Sunday evening**;

Took **15** hours to complete through **step 11** (the counter also serves as 'back' button)


### The good:
* fun fun fun
* the test had enough requirements I could use my fav libraries (redux, saga, rxjs)
* search box has debouncing to avoid hammering the server at every keystroke

### The not so good (yet!!):
* the sagas are not handling server/network errors: they would crash on error with no message to the user
* search box a little quirky, 'prev' and 'next' buttons could be improved
* no tests, ouch

Looking forward to some feedback on the code, regardles of the outcome of the interview process :)

Thanks,
