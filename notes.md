Start Time: **Saturday morning**; End Time: **Sunday evening**;
Took **15** hours to complete through **step 11** (the counter also serves as 'back' button)

### The good:
* fun fun fun
* the test had enough requirements it was worth using Redux and Saga
* search box has debouncing to avoid hammering the server at every keystroke

### The not so good (yet!!):
* the sagas are not handling server/network errors: they would crash on error with no message to the user
* need to improve some of the naming, write more comments, add PropTypes to the components, extract more logic to helpers
* no tests

Looking forward to some feedback on the code, regardles of the outcome of the interview process :)
